# Hospital Readmission Prediction 

This repository contains an academic machine learning project developed by @dinarakurmangaliyeva and @inigopm. 

## Overview
This repository contains all the necessary code, data preprocessing steps, and model development for predicting hospital readmissions. It focuses on leveraging tree-based methods, kernel-based methods, and deep learning approaches to predict hospital readmissions

## Installation

To install the required packages, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
